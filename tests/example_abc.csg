# A set of variables, terminals, and rules define a grammar
# (A start symbol is already defined as S for all grammars)
# Lines starting with the pound symbol will be ignored.

# The line beginning with "V = " denotes the set of variables
# Variables are space delineated
# Yes you can use words as variables
# S cannot be used as a variable as it is already defined
V = A A' B B' C

# The line beginning with "T = " denotes the set of terminals
# Terminals are space delineated
# Yes you can use words as terminals
# But please :( why would you...
# S cannot be used as a terminal
T = a b c

# The line beginning with "R = " denotes the beginning of the rules
# The rules should be the final section of the CSG file
# Rules are newline delineated
# Per KNF, rules must match one of the following formats:
# * AB --> CD
# * A --> AB
# * A --> a
# (for some variables A, B, C, and D, and some terminal a)
R =
S --> A'
A' --> A B'
B' --> B C
A --> a
B --> b
C --> c

# This grammar matches the language x='abc'
